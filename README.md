# VDF
VDF Implementations

## Getting started
This is a simple implementation of Verifiable Delay Function. We have a Golang implementation of 
two candidates including Piertzak VDF (Simple VDF) and Sloth (Modular Square Root). You can locate the candidates in
``
cd go_src/candidates
``.
### Prerequisites

```
Python 2.7.1
```
### Run
In ``main.py`` we run an example VDF operation over a 128bit prime field.
```
python main.py
```
